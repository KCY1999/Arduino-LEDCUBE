*These are some pre-made patterns, some of them are made by me and some by others and some of them are combined to create cool patterns.

*Each pattern needs to be inside a folder, this is how the Arduino program is made, so just open the .ini file inside the folder and it should work perfectly.

* "Complete program" is a combined set of patterns that will run for quiet some time and looks pretty cool, worth a try!
